## Estimate of how many hours you spent on the project

I used the pomodoro technique just like previous assignment to estimate the time I spent on this project. With each pomodoro consisting of 50 minutes of work, over the span of last 2 weeks collectively I was able to complete 20 pomodoros which is equivalent to around 17 hours of work in my case.

## Description of how I tested the code

I made use of the skills I gained from the test harness project and customized it to fit the needs of this project. Then, I went ahead and wrote test casses for each verb.

## Any bugs or issues you could not resolve

There are no bugs in any of my programs.

## An example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved it

There were multiple bottlenecks but the most stubborn issue was to make the autograder pass all its test cases. I had to revisit my code again and again to fix whitespaces, new lines and modify certain responses.

## A list of the three extensions you’ve chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them.

The three extensions I chose are:

1. ambiguity
2. help
3. drop

# a new map file that uses every extension (as applicable—help doesn’t affect the map)

The new map file that i wrote is called "quest.map" and it is situated in the root directory of the project. Every extension verb works with this map without any issue. Obviously, the default verbs are applicable to this map as well.
